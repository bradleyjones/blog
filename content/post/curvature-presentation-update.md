I was fortunate enough to spend the last week at the 6-monthly OpenStack summit
in Vancouver, Canada. Lots of buzz around the conference as usual, these summits
just keep getting bigger and bigger.

Most of my time was spent in the container(docker) talks but I did get a chance
in one of the Horizon developer sessions to give a short update on the Curvature
work, [presentation
here](http://www.caffeinatedbrad.com/curvature-presentation.html).

Difficult not to come back from these conferences full of motivation and
excitement, going to be a really good release with lots of great changes coming!
