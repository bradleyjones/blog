I've lost count of the number of times in the last few years I've tried to start
writing a blog. Every time I have followed the same pattern: spend several weeks
reading about different blogging frameworks -> start using one of them -> decide
I hate it and end up writing my own. I then spend all of my free time writing
the bloody framework instead of the actual content! Not this time
though, I've fallen in love with static site generators and have played around
with the most popular (Jekyll, Octopress, Pelican, etc) and am currently using
Hugo. The best thing about static site generators is that they all use markdown
for writing posts, this means that transferring content between generators is
trivial and I can satisfy my burning desire to always be bleeding edge and
try out new software.

When it comes to new projects/technology I am a bit obsessive, as soon as I get
an idea in my head I have to see it through to the bitter end and this is going
to be the perfect portal to document those journeys.
